rendering of components - when displays itself in the browser

Component Tree - there is an uppermost entry comp (App.js) which will be the parent comp of other child comp (SearchBar.js)

Components - a js funct or a class object that lays out the blueprint for how data is going to be rendered in browser.

Props - used to pass information down the component tree

stateful logic - 
    |
    states - private and fully controlled by component
            

#
hooks are re-writable
#
hooks are backwards compatible
#
hooks are called inside funct
    |
    this adds some local state to the hook

useeffect Hook 
    |
    the word "effect" refers to "side effect"
    |    |
    |    Side Effect - a modification of data in code that's governed by the code's logic
    |
    useeffect also relies on "pure functions"
        |
        pure functions are deterministic I/O events in which the output never changes

--TIPS--

- if a var does not need anything within comp body, then define outside comp to avoid redefininig every called

--Confguring the Expense Button--

1. create another useState hook that takes empty array
2. make new state onClick for the Button
3. have it call the useeffect hook
